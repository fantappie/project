          Drinkstation is a revolutionary startup in the beverage space that
          aims to change how people drink water. Instead of using water bottles,
          a customer can purchase a Drinkstation and get instant, unlimite,
          filtered water that is chilled, sparkling, hot, or alkaline. I was
          fortunate to wrok for the company and help streamline the marketing,
          hiring, and operations processes.

          ORCA Coffee was a startup I worked on that aimed to provide people
          with gourmet, Italian coffee through a coffee machine and pod
          subcription. Although the startup failed, I learned a gret daal about
          marketing, consumer behavior, and manufacturing hardware.
